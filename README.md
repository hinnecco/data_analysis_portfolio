# Henrique Innecco - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Henrique! I have a technical background. I had worked for 13 years in diverse roles in the R&D area, from Product Engineer to Director of Product Management mainly in the industry of energy metering. Since 2015 I am passionate about the data analysis and data science areas. This year (2022) I decided to dedicate a bigger effort to learn and practice about data analysis.    
 
<br>
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### House Sales Listings Analysis
**Repository:** [`House_Data_Analysis`](https://github.com/hinnecco/House_Data_Analysis)    
**Description:** In this project I first collect the data from the OLX website, that is a famous platform in Brazil for users list things for sale, so using requests and beautifulsoup I did the webscraping and collected about 10000 properties information, after saved it in a CSV file, so I started another notebook and start check the dataset, cleaning the data and doing the exploratory data analysis.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** Review of the situation of houses listed for sale

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.

### Kaggle 30 Days of ML
**Description:** 30 days of Machine Learning by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml). The course rapidly covers the most essential skills needed to get hands dirty with data and quickly learn how to build machine learning models.  
**Repository:** Check the repository having jupyter notebooks with the course tasks' solutions ---> [go to repo..](https://github.com/hinnecco/kaggle_30_days_ML)  
**Status:** Completed in August 2021 (please, check the certificates section below).

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
